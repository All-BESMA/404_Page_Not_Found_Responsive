# 404_Page_Not_Found_Responsive
Create a 404 not found page.

Simple project based on the use of Figma to design the model of the project then its conversion into a web page.
In my case I used HTML and CSS for the frontend and nodjs and express for the backend.
I displayed the Desktop and Mobile image by putting a Home return button.
